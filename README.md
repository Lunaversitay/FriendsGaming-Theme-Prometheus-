# FriendsGaming Theme

## This is a custom theme I made from scratch for Friends Gaming (http://friendsgaming.org/) The script used is Prometheus (http://nmscripts.com/)

## What?
After talking to Marcuz for a bit about Prometheus #2 I decided to make this theme. I made it completely from scratch, using the inspect element as a core feature to knowing what I was re-doing. This is currently a-custom to Friends Gaming and was NOT made with the Theme Editor.

## Stuff that wasn't changed
Sadly some stuff could not be changed due to the fact it's inside the core file, so RIP those, such as the Text color on a button and the Admin rank on a support ticket being green.
